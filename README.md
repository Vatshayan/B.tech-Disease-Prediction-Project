Final Year Project on Diseases Prediction System Developed though Machine Learning and Python

**Machine Learning** - Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

**Scikit-learn (Sklearn)** is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

This System Predict Different types of Disease through given Symptoms. 

Datasets contain more than 4000 types of Diseases. 

Two Types of Dataset Involved -
1. Testing 
2. Traning
